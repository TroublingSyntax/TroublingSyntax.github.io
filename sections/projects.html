		<h2>STM32F031 Microcontroller Development Board</h2>
		<p>The main goal of this personal project was to develop a simple breakout development board that exposed the major functionalities of the STM32F0 series microcontroller through pinouts that are easily accessed. It includes a USB-C interface as well as a JTAG connector for direct programming. I wanted to avoid introducing unneeded components that are often found on name brand boards like the STM32 Nucleo boards or Arduino. The long term goal was to iteratively work on this board and modify it's functionality as needed by other projects. In other words, this was a sort of template with the intention of future (robotics) projects being able to universally use the board with small modifications. For now, I am also working on making firmware that this board can support.</p>
