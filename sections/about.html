	<h1>About</h1>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I'm Kevin Lewis, I'm currently a graduate student at Purdue University pursuing a Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics with a specialization in Astrodynamics and Space Applications. I grew up around electronics and working on vehicles, and decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Northern Illinois University, one of only a handful of the ABET accredited programs in the United states. I've worked on embedded software teams including Robotics Club and many internships at Caterpillar, further developing my skills in software development and integration. Despite my passion for computers and electronics, I have decided to pursue Aerospace Engineering at Purdue with the goal of finding a lifelong career working in the space industry. For more details on my journey and experience so far, feel free to download a copy of my resume or check out the Projects section. - Kevin Lewis</p>
